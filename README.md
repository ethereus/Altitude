# Altitude

**A package manager / tweak store for macOS**

**Project will continue to be open sourced under the UNLICENSE**

Welcome to Altitude,

This project was started for fun by @N0rthwnd and @f4d3z, @even_dev worked on the UI and @NDarazaki worked on backend stuff.
There were many people involved in the creation of Altitude back in 2018, even a famous iOS developer was interested at a time, however as things progressed we realised that the only thing that had gone forward in this project was time. 

A lot of people worked hard but there was hardly any progress made after many months and so the team slowly started to fall apart. Now however the project is being carried on by a few members of the team that have chosen to give their time towards it once more, and we hope that it will be completed this time around.

Anyone is able to make changes or additions to this software although we ask that if possible you also use the UNLICENSE to keep this project free :)

# Important

Applications downloaded are installed to ``/Applications`` with the default macOS apps

System modifications / extensions can be installed anywhere /advanced users only/

Tweaks are injected into GUI processes,

Code injection is dangerous, and might make your computer unstable or unusable if you don't know what you're doing. Install tweaks with care. In case of emergency, delete /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.lsdinjector.plist using the recovery boot.

# Thanks
